# RFC-00009: Codebase Refactoring and Architectural Improvements

- **Status**: Draft
- **Author**: Claude
- **Created**: 2025-05-11

## Background

The FlashCards Desktop application has grown organically with the implementation of several features (RFCs 00001-00008). As the codebase grows, maintaining a clear structure becomes increasingly important for maintainability, testability, and future extensions. Based on a code analysis, we've identified several areas that would benefit from refactoring to improve code organization, maintainability, and adherence to software engineering best practices.

## Problem

The codebase has some structural issues that should be addressed:

1. **Large Files**: Several service files have grown quite large, particularly:
   - `DatabaseService.js` (634 lines)
   - `TranslationService.js` (411 lines)
   - `SessionService.js` (368 lines)
   - `index.html` (1759 lines, with embedded JavaScript)

2. **Mixed Concerns**: The `index.html` file contains both UI structure and extensive JavaScript for application logic, making it difficult to maintain and test.

3. **Limited Modularity**: Some service classes handle multiple responsibilities, which complicates maintenance and testing.

4. **Limited Test Coverage for UI Logic**: Most of the embedded JavaScript in the HTML file is not covered by unit tests.

5. **Documentation Gaps**: As the codebase structure evolves, documentation about architecture and project structure needs to be kept up-to-date.

## Proposal

We propose a comprehensive refactoring of the codebase to address these issues while ensuring that existing functionality remains intact. This refactoring will focus on:

### 1. Service Layer Refactoring

#### 1.1 DatabaseService Refactoring
- Split `DatabaseService.js` into smaller, focused modules:
  - `DatabaseService.js`: Core database functionality (initialization, connection management)
  - `FlashCardRepository.js`: CRUD operations for FlashCards
  - `SessionRepository.js`: CRUD operations for Sessions
  - `SettingsRepository.js`: CRUD operations for Settings
  - `TagRepository.js`: Dedicated module for tag-related operations

#### 1.2 TranslationService Refactoring
- Further modularize translation functionality:
  - `TranslationEvaluator.js`: Focus on translation evaluation logic
  - `TranslationGenerator.js`: Focus on translation generation
  - Enhance the provider pattern for different translation APIs

#### 1.3 SessionService Refactoring
- Split into more focused modules:
  - `SessionCreator.js`: Logic for creating new practice sessions
  - `SessionRunner.js`: Logic for running active sessions
  - `SessionEvaluator.js`: Logic for evaluating answers and updating sessions

### 2. Frontend Refactoring

#### 2.1 Extract JavaScript from HTML
- Move JavaScript code from `index.html` to dedicated module files:
  - `ui/home.js`: Home screen functionality
  - `ui/setup.js`: Session setup screen functionality
  - `ui/practice.js`: Practice screen functionality
  - `ui/results.js`: Results screen functionality
  - `ui/import-export.js`: Import/export functionality
  - `ui/notifications.js`: Notification system
  - `ui/tag-selection.js`: Tag selection component logic

#### 2.2 Component-Based Structure
- Implement a lightweight component approach for UI elements
- Create reusable UI components for common elements:
  - `components/TagSelection.js`
  - `components/Notification.js`
  - `components/Card.js`
  - `components/ProgressBar.js`

### 3. Main Process Refactoring

#### 3.1 IPC Handlers Modularization
- Split IPC handlers in `main.js` into dedicated modules:
  - `ipc/database-handlers.js`
  - `ipc/session-handlers.js`
  - `ipc/translation-handlers.js`
  - `ipc/settings-handlers.js`

#### 3.2 Startup Sequence
- Improve application startup and initialization logic
- Add better error handling and recovery

### 4. Testing Improvements

- Add unit tests for newly created modules
- Implement integration tests for UI components
- Increase test coverage, particularly for frontend logic

### 5. Documentation Updates

- Update architecture documentation in `DESIGN.md`
- Update project structure in `DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Add component and module documentation for new structure
- Add code comments for complex logic

## Implementation Strategy

To minimize disruption and ensure the application remains functional throughout the refactoring process, we will follow a phased approach:

### Phase 1: Service Layer Refactoring
- Refactor the DatabaseService first as it's the largest and most fundamental
- Create new modules while maintaining the existing API
- Update tests to verify equivalence and add new tests for improved coverage

### Phase 2: Frontend Refactoring
- Extract JavaScript from index.html into modules
- Create UI component structure
- Test UI functionality after each extraction

### Phase 3: Main Process Refactoring
- Modularize IPC handlers
- Update startup sequence
- Comprehensive integration testing

### Phase 4: Documentation and Cleanup
- Update all project documentation
- Remove debug code and commented-out sections
- Final review and testing

## Compatibility and Migration

All refactoring will maintain backward compatibility with existing application functionality. No database schema changes will be made as part of this RFC. The user experience will remain unchanged while the codebase structure is improved.

## Testing Approach

- Each refactored module will have corresponding unit tests
- Integration tests will verify that API interactions remain consistent
- E2E tests will verify that user-facing functionality remains intact
- We will aim to maintain or increase overall test coverage

## Success Metrics

- Reduction in file sizes (no file over 300 lines)
- Increase in test coverage (target: 85%+)
- Modularity improvements (measured by module cohesion and coupling)
- Maintainability improvements (measured by code complexity metrics)
- No regression in functionality

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Minimal Refactoring
Focus only on the largest files and most critical issues, leaving other parts of the codebase unchanged. This would require less effort but would provide fewer long-term benefits.

### Alternative 2: Complete Rewrite with Framework
Rewrite the application using a modern frontend framework like React or Vue. This would provide more structure but would represent a much larger effort and risk.

### Alternative 3: Incremental Improvements Only
Address issues as they arise during feature development, without dedicated refactoring effort. This would be less disruptive but wouldn't address systemic issues.

## Conclusion

The proposed refactoring will significantly improve the maintainability, testability, and extensibility of the FlashCards Desktop application without disrupting its functionality. By addressing technical debt early, we'll enable more efficient feature development in the future and create a more robust architecture for the application's continued growth.
